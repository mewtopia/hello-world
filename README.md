# hello-world
this is me, life should be, fun for everyone.

Hi humans and robots! I'm still very new to coding but my recent experiences have encouraged me to try and improve my skills. I believe every sentient life form has the right to a peaceful loving existence and I hope to help accomplish that through this incredible program. I like making music, riding motorbikes, hanging out with my beautiful fiance and enjoying the company of friends and family.

I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to earth tacos.
